<p>In the file <code>letters.c</code> write a function with the following
prototype:</p>

<pre><code>void letters_used(char *line);
</code></pre>

<p>Given a line of text, it should report on which letters are used in
the line. It should count upper- and lower-case letters, and should
report by printing the letters used in alphabetical order and in
lower case. For example, given the the following input as a single
line:</p>

<pre><code>When Mr Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly
be celebrating his eleventyifirst birthday with a party of
special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in
Hobbiton.
</code></pre>

<p>It should print this output (including a newline at the end):</p>

<pre><code>abcdefghiklmnoprstuvwxy
</code></pre>
