<p>Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.</p>

<p>Your body is made up of cells that contain DNA. Those cells
regularly wear out and need replacing, which they achieve by
dividing into daughter cells. In fact, the average human body
experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime!</p>

<p>When cells divide, their DNA replicates too. Sometimes during this
process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with
the incorrect information. If we compare two strands of DNA and
count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes
occurred. This is known as the “Hamming Distance”.</p>

<p>We read DNA using the letters C, A, G and T. Two strands might look
like this:</p>

<p>GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^</p>

<p>They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.</p>

<p>The Hamming Distance is useful for lots of things in science, not
just biology, so it&#39;s a nice phrase to be familiar with :)</p>

<p>Write your code as a single function in <code>compute.c</code> (you can find
the prototype in <code>compute.h</code>). Given two strings, return the Hamming
distance between the two strings. If the strings are of different
lengths, return -1 instead.</p>
