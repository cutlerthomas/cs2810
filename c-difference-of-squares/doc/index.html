<p>Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the
squares of the first N natural numbers.</p>

<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.</p>

<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.</p>

<p>Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten
natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.</p>

<p>Write this as three functions in <code>difference_of_squares.c</code>. You can
find prototypes for the functions in <code>difference_of_squares.h</code>.</p>
